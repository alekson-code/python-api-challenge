With the help of the Pandas library, you can now perform quantitative analysis and create compelling data 
visualizations. However, you will need special tools to programmatically obtain and parse real-world data. 
That’s where APIs come in. An application programming interface (API) is a set of functions that 
applications use to automate the back-and-forth communication between computers.

For this module’s Challenge, we will create a Python script to visualize the weather of over 500 
cities of varying distances from the equator. Then, after your visualization is complete, 
you’ll use your weather data skills to plan future vacations.
